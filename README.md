<h1>Project: Build a Shopping Card</h1>
<h2>Udacity: Frontend Web Development Nanodegree</h2>
This project assignment was to utilize JavaScript to build the core functionality of a shopping cart.
<h3>Official Project Description</h3>
<blockquote>This project aims to challenge you to think like a programmer to create functionality for a real-world scenario. The project iterates on the skills you gained in the previous lesson while also requiring you to build on those skills by using documentation. This project barely touches the surface of what is possible, but it uses many of the foundational skills that will make up most of your future coding projects.</blockquote>
<blockquote>You will be creating the core functionality used for a storefront application. The visual of the storefront and the JavaScript necessary to connect the code you will write to that visual has already been created.</blockquote>
